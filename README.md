# Web Process Mining 

Process Mining system for cloud processing using a simple implemantion of Alpha algorithm. 
Inspired on Wil van der Aalst coursera training and developed for my Bachelor conclusion thesis

 * `process-mining-web` - Where the web magic happens
 * `process-mining-core`- Still empty, but the initial target was to move process-mining-web/src/main/java/br/com/licursi/core/ to it.

## Technologies

 * Spring Boot 
 * D3.js
 * [Dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) (2015 version)
 * Mongodb
